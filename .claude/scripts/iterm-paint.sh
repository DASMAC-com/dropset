# The hook painter. This is the single entry point every Claude Code hook calls.
# It derives the desired state color from the hook event on stdin, writes it to
# this session's state file, and applies it to the TTY immediately.
#
# Why one script (not one hook per color): matching PreToolUse hooks run in
# parallel with no ordering guarantee, so wiring `*`->neutral alongside
# `AskUserQuestion`->green raced and the tab color was non-deterministic. Here a
# single hook per event calls this painter, which picks the color itself, so the
# color is a deterministic function of the event.
#
# Usage:
#   iterm-paint.sh              # hook mode: read the hook JSON on stdin
#   iterm-paint.sh <state-hex>  # direct mode: paint this state now (attend etc.)
