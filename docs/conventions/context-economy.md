# Context economy

**Request less; you usually can't trim more.** An LLM is stateless, so
every turn re-sends the whole conversation as *input*. A tool result
is fetched **once** but **replayed as input on every later turn** for
the rest of the session — the MCP server (or shell, or file) is not
re-queried; it's the transcript replay that recurs. The prompt cache
discounts the replay (~10%) but the tokens are still counted and still
occupy the finite window. So a fat payload early in a long session is
paid many times over. **This is transport-agnostic** — a large
`git diff`, a whole-file `Read`, or a verbose build log behaves
exactly like a fat MCP result; `gh` vs. the MCP is token-neutral for
the same data. The only durable lever is **how much each call returns
into the transcript**:

- **Ask for the narrowest thing that answers the question.** Use the
  narrowest method / subcommand, field-select where the transport
  allows it (`gh … --json <fields>`, a GraphQL projection), paginate
  instead of dumping, and **never re-fetch what's already in context**.
- **Read large known files by slice.** Grep to locate, then `Read`
  with `offset`/`limit`; don't pull a 1000-line file to use 80 lines
  of it. Brief review sub-agents to do the same.
- **Route verbose build logs away from context.** Prefer `-q` /
  `--quiet` so a `cargo` / `make` "Compiling …" cascade doesn't land
  inline. For a noisy target with no quiet flag, run it through the
  quiet runner, `python3 .claude/tools/run_quiet.py -- CMD ARGS…`
  (with optional `--tail N` / `--label L`): it captures the output to a
  temp log and prints only a one-line summary on success, or the
  failing tail plus the exit code and log path on failure (so you can
  `Read` more by slice). A green build is then paid once, not replayed
  every later turn. (Do this within the shell rules — the runner
  captures inside Python, so the command line carries no redirect.)
- **Scope a sub-agent fan-out.** Inlining the same large diff into N
  reviewers pays for N resident copies; scope each agent to its files,
  or have them read one shared file, rather than inlining N times.
- **Polls multiply payload.** A read issued once is cheap; the same
  read polled across a CI / merge wait is paid per poll *and* per
  later turn — that's why `review-pr`'s waits use the compact `gh`
  reads above rather than the full-object MCP calls.

**Track consumption ideas as you go.** When something reads as
wasteful mid-session — a payload you only needed a slice of, a call
that repeated, an avoidable fan-out — keep a running note of it. At
session end `/session-metrics` pairs those observations with the
tool's ranked token sinks to emit *grounded* trim recommendations
(the lever, and the concrete skill / convention-doc edit it implies)
into the Linear "Session Metrics" inbox, which `housekeeping` later
mines. The tool says *where* the tokens went; your running notes say
*why* and *what to change*.
